# School District Analysis with Jupyter Notebook and Python

## Overview of the project
 
  Maria and her supervisor analyze the student performance (Math and Reading) and investigate the budget for each student/school for this specific school district. In this challenge, we will take out the ninth graders’ math and reading scores and see how this action impact the overall performance of the school district.

### Results

* When we calculate the total school and total student, we apply count() function and these two numbers are the same as module. However, when we calculate the student performance, the count for the students will ignore the NaN from the ninth graders. So, except % Passing Math and % Overall passing, other stats are slightly a little bit higher than original numbers. See below screenshot 1 or original and screenshot 2 for the modified numbers from removing the ninth graders.
